    <h2><p><strong>Bio</strong><br></h2>
    <p> I go to Hamilton High School and I'm going to be a senior.<br> I skipped a grade (kindergarden) and I'm 16.<p> I think I might pursue a career in computer science<br>
			Currently, I'm in school for the arts but that won't last long.<br> For college I'm thinking of going to LMU.

				<p> I grew up in different parts of Los Angeles throughout my childhood. Now I live close to Inglewood near Washington High. On my free time I'm either in my room or
					hanging out with my friends. I enjoy the sun and the beach because I'm a Californian. Venice beach is where I go the most because Santa Monica is super crowded but Docwieler
					isn't too bad. I used to make movies on my mom's computer and then I switched to taking pictures and now I'm into coding. I have two little brothers and I'm the only girl.
					Also I have a fear of dogs but I want a pomeranian husky. My favorite movie of all time is the pursuit of happiness. Someting about it is just so amazing and it's the only
					movie that can make me cry. <p>
